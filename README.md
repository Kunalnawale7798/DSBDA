DSBDA Sample problem statement and there solution



Problem Statement 1 [refer practical no:1]
1. Load the given iris data set into data frame.
2. Add column names to data frame. (if column names are not present)
3. Display first and five rows of data frame.
4. Display initial statistics of data frame.
5. Check data types of columns in data frame.
6. Check dimensions of data frame.
7. Perform label encoding and convert categorical variable into quantitative variables. Use any
label encoding technique and apply it on ‘Species’ column of data frame.
Problem Statement 2 [refer practical no:2]
Part A:
1. Load the given academic performance data set into data frame
2. Checking for missing values using isnull()
3. filling missing values using mean, median and standard deviation of that column
( Note: use fillna()]
Part B:
1. Load the data set demo.csv into data frame
2. Display the above data frame
3. Select the columns for boxplot and draw the boxplot
4. print the outliers for each column with reference to the box plot.
5. Detecting outliers for math_score column using z-score normalization

Problem Statement 3
Part A:
1. Load the data set eg. Mall_Customers.csv into data frame.
2. Find mean,median,mode and standard deviation of all columns in data frame.
3. Provide summary statistics of income group by the age groups.
4. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and quantitative variable is income,
then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the age groups. Create a list that
contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical variable.
Part B:
1. Load the given iris data set into data frame.
2. Add column names to data frame. (if column names are not present)
3. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean,
standard deviation etc. of the species of ‘Iris-setosa’, ‘Iris-versicolor’ and ‘Iris-versicolor’ of
iris.csv dataset
Problem Statement 4:
1. Create a Linear Regression Model using Python/R to predict home prices using Boston Housing
Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). The Boston Housing dataset contains
information about various houses in Boston through different parameters. There are 506
samples and 14 feature variables in this dataset.
Problem Statement 5:
1. Implement logistic regression using Python/R to perform classification on
Social_Network_Ads.csv dataset.
2. Compute Confusion matrix to find TP, FP, TN, FN, Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, Recall on the
given dataset.

Problem Statement 6:
1. Implement Simple Naïve Bayes classification algorithm using Python/R on iris.csv dataset.
2. Compute Confusion matrix to find TP, FP, TN, FN, Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, Recall on the
given dataset.
Problem Statement 7:
Part A:
1. Extract Sample document and apply following document preprocessing methods:
a. Tokenization
b. POS Tagging
c. stop words removal
d. Stemming and Lemmatization.
Sample Text
"Tokenization is the first step in text analytics. The process of breaking down a text paragraph into
smaller chunks such as words or sentences is called Tokenization."
Part B:
2. Create representation of document by calculating Term Frequency and Inverse Document
Frequency.
Sample Document
documentA = 'Jupiter is the largest Planet'
documentB = 'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun'
Problem Statement 8: (refer practical 8)
1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic'. The dataset contains 891 rows and contains information about the
passengers who boarded the unfortunate Titanic ship. Use the Seaborn library to see if we can find
any patterns in the data. (Draw Distibution Plot,Categorical Plots etc and record your observations)
2. Write a code to check how the price of the ticket (column name: 'fare') for each passenger is
distributed by plotting a histogram. (Draw histogram plot and record your observation)
Problem Statement 9: (refer practical 9)
1.Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic' as used in the above problem.
2.Plot a box plot for distribution of age with respect to each gender along with the information about
whether they survived or not. (Column names : 'sex' and 'age')
3. Write observations on the inference from the above statistics.
Problem Statement 10: (refer practical 10)
1. Load the Iris flower dataset into a DataFrame.
2. List down the features and their types (e.g., numeric, nominal) available in the dataset.
3. Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions.
4. Create a box plot for each feature in the dataset.
5. Compare distributions and identify outliers.
